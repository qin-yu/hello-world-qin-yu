My first git repository!

----08/Mar/2016--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is my first git repository which is created by following the tutorial on https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ and I am pretty happy because I can finally use git to share my design of COMP103P app~


Why is there no change!! Even if i did change it when i chose a branch.
